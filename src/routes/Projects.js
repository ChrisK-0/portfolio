                            created an app for employees of the organisation.
                            Employees can view their work details, change
                            specific account details and view work costs.
                            Website also includes an admin user for managing
                            other users.

                            For front-end we used SvelteKit Javascript framework
                            with Microsoft SQL Server for database management. I
                            set up the database connection to the front-end with
                            Prisma JS and uploaded the website to my mentor's
                            linux server and hosted it with PM2.
